### 📚 Section-wise Distribution:

### 🧠 Key Insights:
- Many questions were easy and could be solved through logic, which naturally develops after studying all 8 assignments.
- Many questions were indirectly based on the assignments, but thoroughly covering them laid a strong foundation for understanding and reasoning.
- Only one numerical question was present — and that too was simple (related to the default block size in HDFS and calculating the number of blocks and replicas, etc.).
